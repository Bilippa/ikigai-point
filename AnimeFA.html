            <h4> Demon Slayer </h4>
            <img class="poster" src="demonslayerposter.png">
            <p class="paragraph "> The story takes place in Taish≈ç-era Japan, 
                where a secret society, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. 
                The demons are former humans who were turned into demons by Muzan injecting them with his own blood, and they feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art ", and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they're decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from Wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special breathing techniques, known as "Breathing Styles", which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance. This helps increase their chances fighting against demons. -Wikipedia
